Title: Researching Responsive Webapps
Target pub date: 2015-01-18

In a previous post I wrote about my initial thoughts regarding responsive Single
Page Applications (SPAs).  I've now done a bit of digging to find out folks
think about this topic.

I found Jason Grigsby's series of blog posts [Responsive Design for
Apps](http://blog.cloudfour.com/responsive-design-for-apps-part-1/) especially
interesting. Jason made the following points:

* A lot of the web UI frameworks have a library of mobile widgets and a library
  of desktop widgets
* Some of these web framework authors make the point that phones are a
  fundamentally different platform from tablets and likewise different from
  desktop
* However, Jason wonders what is that fundamental difference and where are the
  lines being drawn
* We now have many large phones and small tablets so that the height of a large
  phone can easily exceed the width of a tablet
* Windows 8 devices with touch screens also challenge what we can assume about
  input devices based on the size of the screen
* He writes about how Jeremy Keith once wrote about how web designers
  participate in collective, consensual hallucination. The idea that laptops
  have a large screen and keyboard and tablets have large screens and touch fit
  into that.
* If you design targets for touch then desktop users will be able to use them
  too. In fact, they will be easier to use due to Fitt's law
* Found that making a desktop component/app responsive is very hard.  It is
  easier to figure out how the app would be designed for mobile first and then
  enhance it for desktop.
* Embracing constraints to lead to better design.
* Content itself is the interface
* Rethink the desktop app in terms of the mobile first design
* Look at how Apple designs iPhone, iPad and Mac Mail app
* Nested doll design pattern: from list of items to greater detail or sub-lists
  of that item
* Bento box pattern: display list and detail on the same screen
* adaptive layout - multiple fixed sizes (as opposed to fluid)
* "responsiveness for apps is inevitable"
