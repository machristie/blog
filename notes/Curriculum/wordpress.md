# How WordPress Works

* Browsers ask web servers for web pages
* sometimes web servers return static web pages
* but web servers can also execute computer code that generates a web page to return to the browser. This is called a *dynamic* web page.
* WordPress is a computer program written in PHP that can be used to create a dynamic website, typically a blog.
* The content of a WordPress site is stored in a *database*.  A database has tables in which it store different kinds of data.  In particular, WordPress uses the *MySQL* database which is a *relational database*. In relational database the tables of data are related to each other.
